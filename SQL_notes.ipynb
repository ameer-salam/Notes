        "4. **Data Redundancy**: Minimizes repeated storage of data, reducing redundancy.\n",
        "5. **Data Consistency**: Maintains consistency by ensuring that interconnected data is accurately related, which is not readily achievable in traditional file systems.\n",
        "6. **Data Independence**: Hides low-level details from users, allowing them to interact with data without concerning themselves with how it is stored or maintained.\n",
        "7. **Security and Access Control**: Provides robust mechanisms for securing data and controlling access to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify data.\n",
        "8. **Abstraction and Ease of Use**: Offers various levels of data abstraction, making it easier to manage, understand, and manipulate data.\n"
