        "6. **Data Independence**: Hides low-level details from users, allowing them to interact with data without concerning themselves with how it is stored or maintained.\n",
        "7. **Security and Access Control**: Provides robust mechanisms for securing data and controlling access to ensure that only authorized users can access or modify data.\n",
